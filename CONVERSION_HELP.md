# Contacting BrepMFR Authors for Data Conversion Tools

## Original Paper/Repository Information:
- **Repository**: https://github.com/zhangshuming0668/BrepMFR
- **Paper**: "BrepMFR: Enhancing machining feature recognition in B-rep models through deep learning and domain adaptation"
- **Dataset**: Available on Science Data Bank
- **Contact**: Check the repository for author contact information

## What to Ask:
1. Do you have STEP-to-BIN conversion tools?
2. Can you share the preprocessing pipeline?
3. What CAD libraries did you use?
4. Are there specific requirements for STEP file format?

## Alternative Approaches:
1. Use their pre-processed dataset from Science Data Bank
2. Implement your own conversion using:
   - OpenCASCADE (pythonocc-core)
   - FreeCAD Python API
   - Open3D for geometric processing
   - Other CAD processing libraries
